# CASE SMD Challenge

Inspired [this unfortunate SMD project](https://hackaday.io/project/25265-an-unfortunate-smd-project) we have created the CASE SMD Challenge to provide our members with an opportunity for immense soldering frustration. If you are able to fully assemble the board it also doubles as  a small USB development board. You can now flash all the LED:s that were painstakingly added to the board or hook it up to other gizmos via the test points on the PCB.
